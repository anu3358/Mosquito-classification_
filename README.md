# 🦟 Mosquito Species Classification with Deep Learning

🔬 A smart approach to identifying disease-carrying mosquitoes using AI.

---

## 🌍 Overview

Accurate identification of mosquito species is vital for controlling vector-borne diseases like **malaria**, **dengue**, and **Zika virus**. This project uses **deep learning** to classify mosquito species from images with high precision.

> From swatting blindly to predicting scientifically 🧠

---

## 🧠 Model Highlights

- Built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification  
- Trained on a labeled dataset of mosquito species images  
- Capable of distinguishing between key vector species (e.g., *Aedes*, *Anopheles*, *Culex*)  
- Achieves high accuracy through data augmentation and transfer learning (e.g., using ResNet, MobileNet)
